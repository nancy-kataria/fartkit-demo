# FartKit

Everything you need to build a modern web application, powered by **FartKit**.

### Creating a project

To create a new FartKit project, use the command:

```sh
deno -A jsr:@fartlabs/fartkit
```

This will launch an interactive prompt to help you scaffold a new project from
scratch.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project, start a development server:

```bash
# start the development server
deno task dev

# or start the server with environment variables
deno task start
```

Run the following command to run the opinionated pre-commit tasks:

```bash
deno task precommit
```

## Deploying

To deploy your FartKit application, see
[Deno Deploy](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/).
